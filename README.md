# PCA, pPCA in Julia/Turing

(Probabilistic, Latent) Principle Components Analysis Bayesian Householder Rotation invariant form.

Copied and adapted from many sources (all credit there), especially:

Rajbir S. Nirwan and Nils Bertschinger, 2019. Proceedings of the 36 th International Conference on Machine Learning, Long Beach, California, PMLR 97, 

- https://github.com/rsnirwan/HouseholderBPCA/blob/master/talk.pdf
- https://turing.ml/v0.21/tutorials/11-probabilistic-pca
- https://juliastats.org/MultivariateStats.jl/dev/pca/

And the main Julia/Turing tutorial hadhad done the brunt of the conversion from python/Stan.

Minor changes and adaptation for my own needs.
